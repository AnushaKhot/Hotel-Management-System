# Hotel-Management-System
This is a Hotel Management program that may be used to manage activities such as saving customer information, booking rooms of four distinct types, ordering food for specific rooms, unbooking rooms, and displaying the bill. It can also be used to view various room attributes and availability. It is a menu-driven program that runs till the user closes it. Once the program exits, the existing status of the hotel (client details, booked rooms, food ordered) is saved in a file so that the old details are not lost when we restart the program.  

Topics Used-
Classes and Objects, Inheritance, File Handling with Objects, ArrayList, implementing Interface, User defined exception and Exception handling.
